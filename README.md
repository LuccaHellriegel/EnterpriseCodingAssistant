This is a tiny CLI for generating Java boilerplate for common patterns that I like to use.
Mostly useful if it is not possible to abstract these patterns otherwise (e.g. for time or complexity reasons).
In my current project, I finally got some time to abstract the common patterns in some base classes (careful with that), so this is not in heavy use anymore.
